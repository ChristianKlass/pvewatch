# PVEWatch

A single Docker container that tells you when your Proxmox VE backups fail, VMs go down, or storage is filling up. It doesn't need hook scripts, Prometheus, or Grafana.

PVEWatch reads your Proxmox task log via API token, stores per-VM backup history in SQLite, and sends alerts to email and/or Discord.

---

## What it monitors

- **Backup jobs**: alerts on any `vzdump` task that fails or exits non-zero, with the last 20 lines of the task log included in the alert
- **Batch backups**: "backup all VMs" jobs (single task covering all VMs) are parsed per-VM from the task log
- **Backup history**: per-VM heatmap of every backup result for the last 3–30 days, visible in the web dashboard
- **Storage pools**: alerts when any pool crosses the threshold (default 85%)
- **Weekly digest**: Sunday morning summary of which VMs backed up, storage levels, and failure count

## What it does not do

- Monitor Proxmox Backup Server (PBS) directly. It sees PBS-destined backups via the Proxmox task log, but does not query PBS itself
- Modify anything on your Proxmox host

---

## Requirements

- Proxmox VE 7.4 or later (single node or cluster)
- Docker or Podman
- An SMTP server or Discord webhook for alert delivery

---

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a read-only API token in Proxmox

PVEWatch never writes to your cluster. It needs a PVEAuditor token.

1. **Datacenter → Permissions → Users**: create `monitoring@pve` (Realm: Proxmox VE authentication server)
2. **Datacenter → Permissions → API Tokens** → Add
   - User: `monitoring@pve`, Token ID: `pvewatch`
   - **Uncheck** "Privilege Separation"
   - Copy the secret. It is only shown once
3. **Datacenter → Permissions → Add → User Permission**
   - Path: `/`, User: `monitoring@pve`, Role: `PVEAuditor`, Propagate: checked

Your `PVE_TOKEN_ID` will be `monitoring@pve!pvewatch`.

### Step 2: Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Minimum required:

```env
PVE_HOST=192.168.1.100
PVE_NODE=pve
PVE_TOKEN_ID=monitoring@pve!pvewatch
PVE_TOKEN_SECRET=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Plus at least one alert target:

```env
# Discord
ALERT_DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/CHANNEL_ID/TOKEN

# Email (SMTP)
ALERT_EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
ALERT_EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
ALERT_EMAIL_SMTP_USER=you@gmail.com
ALERT_EMAIL_SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
ALERT_EMAIL_TO=you@example.com
ALERT_EMAIL_FROM=pvewatch@example.com
```

### Step 3: Run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Or without compose:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pvewatch \
  --env-file .env \
  -v pvewatch-data:/data \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/christianklass/pvewatch:latest
```

Images are published for amd64 and arm64. To build from source instead: `docker build -t pvewatch:latest .`

### Step 4: Verify

```bash
docker logs pvewatch
```

Expected on first start:
```
PVEWatch starting...
Connected to Proxmox pve (version 9.x.x)
Importing backup history: last 30 days...
History import complete: 312 tasks across cluster
Monitoring active. Polling every 15 minutes.
```

Open `http://your-docker-host:8080` for the backup dashboard.

---

## Multi-node clusters

No extra configuration needed. PVEWatch connects to `PVE_HOST` and uses the cluster API to discover all online nodes, then polls each node's task log independently. All VMs and containers across the cluster appear in the dashboard automatically.

`PVE_NODE` is used as a fallback if the cluster API is unreachable, and for storage monitoring (storage is queried per node, so only the configured node's pools are shown).

---

## Dashboard

The web UI is read-only. Open `http://your-docker-host:8080`.

By default there is no authentication. To require a login, set `WEB_UI_USERNAME` and `WEB_UI_PASSWORD`. This protects the dashboard, the JSON API, and `/metrics` with HTTP Basic Auth, while the `/healthz` and `/readyz` probe endpoints stay open so Kubernetes probes keep working.

- Summary stats: total VMs, backed-up count, failure events (with unresolved indicator), never-backed-up count
- Per-VM backup heatmap with 3/5/7/14/30 day range selector
- Sortable columns: Node, VM/Container, Status, Last backup
- Per-node filter toggle for both VMs and storage pools
- Storage pool usage cards, deduplicated across nodes
- Four colour themes (Dark, Light, Monokai, Solarized), saved in the browser

---

## API

All endpoints are served on the same port as the dashboard and handled concurrently. If `WEB_UI_USERNAME` is set, they require HTTP Basic Auth (Prometheus supports this via `basic_auth` in the scrape config).

### `GET /api/status`

Returns a JSON snapshot of current cluster state. Accepts an optional `?days=` query parameter (3, 5, 7, 14, or 30; default 7) which controls the backup history window.

```json
{
  "node": "proxmox",
  "last_poll": "2026-04-20 13:00",
  "last_poll_ts": 1776627197,
  "days": 7,
  "summary": {
    "total_vms": 16,
    "backed_up": 16,
    "failure_events": 2,
    "failure_vms": 1,
    "unresolved_failures": 0,
    "never_backed_up": 0
  },
  "vms": [ ... ],
  "vm_nodes": ["prox2", "proxmox"],
  "storage": [ ... ],
  "storage_nodes": ["prox2", "proxmox"],

---

### `GET /metrics`

Returns Prometheus-format metrics. Scrape this endpoint with your Prometheus instance. The `days` query parameter is not supported here; the window always uses the configured default (7 days).

The primary value-add over the [native Proxmox exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-pve/prometheus-pve-exporter) is per-VM backup outcome history, which Proxmox does not expose as metrics.

**Cluster-level gauges**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pvewatch_vms_total` | Total VMs and containers |
| `pvewatch_vms_backed_up` | VMs with at least one successful backup in the window |
| `pvewatch_vms_never_backed_up` | VMs with no backup record |
| `pvewatch_backup_failure_events` | Total failed backup days in the window |
| `pvewatch_vms_unresolved_failures` | VMs whose most recent backup is still a failure |
| `pvewatch_last_poll_timestamp_seconds` | Unix timestamp of the last successful Proxmox poll |

**Per-VM gauges**, labelled with `vmid`, `vm`, `node`, `type`

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pvewatch_backup_last_success_timestamp_seconds` | Unix timestamp of the most recent *successful* backup. `0` if the VM has never had a successful backup. |
| `pvewatch_backup_last_status` | Most recent backup result: `1`=ok, `0`=failed, `-1`=stale (>8 days ago), `-2`=never |
| `pvewatch_backup_failures_window` | Number of failed backup days in the current window |

**Per-pool gauges**, labelled with `pool`, `node`

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pvewatch_storage_used_bytes` | Bytes used |
| `pvewatch_storage_total_bytes` | Total capacity in bytes |

**Example Alertmanager rule**

```yaml
- alert: VMBackupMissing
  expr: time() - pvewatch_backup_last_success_timestamp_seconds > 86400 * 2
  for: 1h
  labels:
    severity: warning
  annotations:
    summary: "No successful backup for {{ $labels.vm }} in 48h"
```

## Troubleshooting

**`Authentication failed` on startup**

Check the `PVE_TOKEN_ID` format: it must be `user@realm!tokenname`, e.g. `monitoring@pve!pvewatch`. The secret is the UUID copied when the token was created.

**`SSL certificate verify failed`**

Most Proxmox installs use a self-signed cert. Set `PVE_VERIFY_SSL=false` (the default).

**No backup results / all VMs show no history**

1. Confirm the token has `PVEAuditor` on path `/` with Propagate checked.
2. Check whether your backup jobs are "backup all VMs" jobs. These are batch tasks, and PVEWatch parses them from the task log. If you only ever ran batch backups, the per-VM results come from log parsing, not the task API directly.
3. Run `docker logs pvewatch` and look for `History import complete: N tasks`. If N is 0, the token likely lacks permission to read tasks.

**VMs appear on the wrong node**

Not an issue. PVEWatch queries all cluster nodes and the cluster resource API, so VM placement does not matter.

**Email alerts not arriving**

For Gmail: generate an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords and use it as `ALERT_EMAIL_SMTP_PASS`.

**Discord webhook not working**

Test it directly:
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"content":"PVEWatch test"}' \
  YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

**Container exits immediately**

Run `docker logs pvewatch`. If the error is `No alert target configured`, add at least one of `ALERT_DISCORD_WEBHOOK` or `ALERT_EMAIL_TO`.

---

## Storage modes

PVEWatch supports three storage backends, controlled by `DATABASE_URL`:

### SQLite (default)
No configuration needed. The database is stored at `DATA_PATH/pvewatch.db` inside the container.

For Docker, mount a volume:
```bash
docker run -v pvewatch-data:/data ...
```

For Kubernetes, apply `k8s/pvc.yaml` and uncomment the volume section in `k8s/deployment.yaml`.

### PostgreSQL
Set `DATABASE_URL` to a postgres connection string:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/pvewatch
```
Requires `psycopg2-binary` (`pip install pvewatch[postgres]`). Recommended for Kubernetes.

### In-memory (no persistence)
```env
DATABASE_URL=memory
```
Uses an in-memory SQLite database. On every restart, history is re-pulled from the Proxmox API so the dashboard still shows full history. Trade-offs:
- Alerts may re-fire after a restart (deduplication state is lost)
- Weekly digest is not available
- Storage history over time is not tracked (only current state is shown)

---

## How it works

On startup, PVEWatch imports the last `HISTORY_DAYS` of backup tasks from all cluster nodes into its database. After that it polls every `POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES`.

For each poll it:
1. Fetches `vzdump` tasks from every online cluster node
2. For single-VM tasks: stores the result directly
3. For batch tasks (all-VM jobs): fetches the full task log and parses per-VM start/finish/error lines
4. For any new failure, sends an immediate alert with the last 20 log lines

Nothing is written to your Proxmox host. See [Storage modes](#storage-modes) for database options.
